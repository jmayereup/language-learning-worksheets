      "text": "Dolphins are some of the most intelligent and beloved animals in the ocean. They are not fish, but marine mammals, which means they breathe air and give birth to live babies. Dolphins have a smooth, rubbery skin and a curved dorsal fin on their backs. They are famous for their playful behavior. You can often see them jumping out of the water and riding the waves created by boats. There are over forty different species of dolphins, and they live in oceans all around the world, from tropical waters to colder seas. The bottlenose dolphin is the most common.",

      "text": "Dolphins are very social animals. They live in groups called pods. A pod can have just a few dolphins, or it can have hundreds of them! Living in a pod helps them stay safe from predators like sharks. It also makes hunting for food much easier. Dolphins have a special way of finding food called echolocation. They make clicking sounds that travel through the water. When the sound hits an object, like a fish, it bounces back to the dolphin. This echo tells the dolphin exactly where the fish is, how big it is, and how fast it is moving.",

      "text": "Communication is incredibly important in a dolphin pod. Dolphins talk to each other using a mix of clicks, whistles, and body language. Scientists believe that every bottlenose dolphin has a unique 'signature whistle.' This whistle acts just like a human name! When a dolphin uses its signature whistle, it tells the others, 'I am here!' Dolphins also show their feelings through body language. They might slap the water with their tails to show they are angry or excited. They also love to play together, which is a great way for young dolphins to learn important skills for adult life.",
