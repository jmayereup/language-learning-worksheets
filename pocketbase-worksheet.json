    "title": "The Joy of Creating",
    "readingText": "Finding the perfect hobby can be a wonderful way to relax and express creativity. In my community, people have very diverse interests that keep them busy during their free time. My neighbor, Thomas, is a skilled craftsman who loves to build things with wood. He spends his weekends in a dusty workshop creating sturdy oak tables and elegant chairs for his family. His daughter, Sophia, has a more modern passion; she prefers to build machines. She is currently working on a small robot that can help clean the floor!\n\nPersonally, I find great joy in creating things with my hands. I love to grow a garden in my backyard, where I cultivate organic vegetables and colorful flowers. With the fresh ingredients I harvest, I often go to the kitchen to bake bread. There is nothing better than the smell of a warm loaf fresh from the oven. I also enjoy fashion, so I recently learned to make my own clothes using unique fabrics and patterns. My cousin, Clara, is similarly artistic, but she prefers to make jewelry from beads and silver wire. Because we create more than we can use, we recently started to sell things online. It is thrilling to see our handmade items travel to new homes around the world.",
